# Advanced_RAG

Dive into the world of advanced language understanding with `Advanced_RAG`. Our Python notebooks offer a guided tour of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Langchain framework, perfect for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with rich, contextual knowledge.

## Visual Flows

### 1. Basic RAG Flow
Understand the journey of a query through RAG, from user input to the final generated response, all depicted in a clear, visual flow.

### 2. Advanced RAG Techniques
Explore the intricate components that make up an advanced RAG system, from query construction to generation.

### 3. Multi Query Retriever
Get to grips with the Multi Query Retriever structure, which enhances the retrieval process by selecting the best responses from multiple sources.
