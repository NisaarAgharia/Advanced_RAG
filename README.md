# RAG_From_Scratch

Dive into the world of advanced language understanding with `RAG_From_Scratch`. Our Python notebooks offer a guided tour of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Langchain framework, perfect for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with rich, contextual knowledge.

## Notebooks Overview

Below is a detailed overview of each notebook present in this repository:

- **1_rag_from_scratch_Introduction.ipynb**
  - _Basic process of building RAG app(s)_
