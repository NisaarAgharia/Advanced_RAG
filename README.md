## Overview
Dive into the world of advanced language understanding with `RAG_From_Scratch`. Our Python notebooks offer a guided tour of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Langchain framework, perfect for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with rich, contextual knowledge.

## RAG User Flow
Understand the journey of a query through RAG, from user input to the final generated response, all depicted in a clear, visual flow.
